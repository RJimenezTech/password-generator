## Installation

There are no installation steps for this project. It is a static website. 

## Usage

Click the link above under "Link to deployed project." The page will look like the image under "Image of the project." Simply click the button titled "Generate Password." You will be prompted with questions about the requirements that your password needs to meet, including password length, upper/lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Once the criteria are selected, a random password that meets the requirements will be automatically generated.
